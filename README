1. Introduction

    liblxi is an open source software library which offers a simple API for
    communicating with LXI compatible instruments. The API allows applications
    to discover instruments on your network, send SCPI commands, and receive
    responses.

    Currently the library supports VXI-11/TCP and RAW/TCP connections. Future
    work include adding support for the newer and more efficient HiSlip
    protocol which is used by next generation LXI instruments.

    The library is based on the VXI-11 RPC protocol implementation which is
    part of the asynDriver EPICS module, which, at time of writing, is
    available from: http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/modules/soft/asyn/index.html


2. The liblxi API

    The API is small and simple. It includes functions required for discovering
    and communicating SCPI messages with LXI devices:

     int lxi_init(void);
     int lxi_discover(struct lxi_info_t *info, int timeout, lxi_discover_t type);
     int lxi_connect(char *address, int port, char *name, int timeout, lxi_protocol_t protocol);
     int lxi_send(int device, char *message, int length, int timeout);
     int lxi_receive(int device, char *message, int length, int timeout);
     int lxi_disconnect(int device);

    Note: type is DISCOVER_VXI11 or DISCOVER_MDNS
    Note: protocol is VXI11 or RAW


3. API usage

    Here is a simple code example on how to use the liblxi API:

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <string.h>
     #include <lxi.h>

     int main()
     {
         char response[65536];
         int device, length, timeout = 1000;
         char *command = "*IDN?";

         // Initialize LXI library
         lxi_init();

         // Connect to LXI device
         device = lxi_connect("10.42.0.42", 0, "inst0", timeout, VXI11);

         // Send SCPI command
         lxi_send(device, command, strlen(command), timeout);

         // Wait for response
         lxi_receive(device, response, sizeof(response), timeout);

         printf("%s\n", response);

         // Disconnect
         lxi_disconnect(device);
     }

    The example above prints the ID string of the LXI instrument. For example,
    a Rigol DS1104Z oscilloscope would respond:
    
     RIGOL TECHNOLOGIES,DS1104Z,DS1ZA1234567890,00.04.03
